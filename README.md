# A/B testing ways to boost the conversion of the online store visitors
The project from the Making Business Decisions Based on Data sprint of the Practicum DA/DS course.

## Description
Here we have a dataset of hypotheses for A/B testing, visits, and orders of an online store. We want to test them to find out what can boost our revenue.

First, we should do some data preprocessing: clean the data and change data types. After doing so, we could analyze our data.

## Conclusion
After preprocessing and filtering out the customers who appeared in both testing groups, we looked at the hypotheses. 

Applying the ICE framework, we concluded that the best hypothesis is "Launch a promotion that gives users discounts on their birthdays." But using the RICE framework, we found that the best is "Add a subscription form to all the main pages."

Using graphical analysis, we concluded there could be some difference in order sizes and conversion. Then, charting the number of orders per user and order prices, we found some outliers and filtered out these orders.

Testing on raw data gave us inconsistent results about the difference in conversion. But based on filtered data, we concluded the presence of a statistically significant difference between the groups. 
Neither raw nor filtered data showed any difference in average order sizes; they belong to the same statistical population.

I suggest stopping the test and concluding that Group B has better results. Although the purchase size is the same, the conversion in this group is higher. The higher conversion provides more orders which leads to more considerable revenue.
